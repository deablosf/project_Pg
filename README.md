SECTION 1: Synopsis
Tagline under title: On the verge of a New Era for mankind, a Clandestine group of International Entities are losing its grip on a Centuries old secret; The Superman Is Real. (Done)
Undertagline: All over the world civilization/society is ready to take it's next leap. Whither that's closer to utopian or dystopian is still unknown. But to the Cookie Jar this coiled uncertain future is the farthist concern. For centuries; they have hidden the existance of, captured and cataloged the powered human offshoots known to them as Exim. Now, fracturing, the number of surfacing Exim are exploding, worst it is coming to their attention that Project Powerpunk has been initiated.
Followed by a brakedown of the now and the work of the cookie jar. It ends with the fact that someone has initiated an old secret government project called Powerpunk.

SECTION 5: The B+ System
Feel, Consequence and Agency through versitility - In the B+ System, we wanted a lot; we wanted players to Feel powerful, we wanted player's actions to matter and we wanted to Feel like our characters were part of the world they're in. in almost everything they do, even down to the dice you roll.
DIE-STEPS: (The stronger you get the larger value die you roll. Through exploits and other means you can temporially increase your trait's dice. )
Practices: (Investing in knoweldge that can help your character in and out of combat. This added block allows the characters to interact with the world in more ways than just combat.)
COMBAT: (Physical Combat being based on fighting video games like Street Fighter, MVC2 and rpgs like Xenogears and Legend of Dragoon. With the forms and styles you can have your character fight the way you want them to fight. There is no perfect combination to victory but the combination that perfectly fits your character is. 
Social brings in a different view to combat and a new breed of fighter, one that plays with emotions and what a character believes. Appealing to a characters better or worse natures, convincing them that everything they think matters doesn't, putting foes on a rollercoaster of terror and lust and so much more. This added with the Styles and forms mechanics turns a simple back and forth of words into a dual with tongues sharper than any double edge sword.)
POWERS: (These are powers in all sense of the word. Built specifically for Powerpunk to give the Feel of Power.)

because you have more options than just punch obsticle in face your characters feel like a genuine part of the world. And GMs now have access to more obsticles than faces to fist.
Combat both physical and Social.
